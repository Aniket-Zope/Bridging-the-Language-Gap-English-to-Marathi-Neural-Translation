## About
This project demonstrates Neural Machine Translation (NMT) using a Sequence-to-Sequence model with attention mechanism. It focuses on translating English sentences to Marathi sentences. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras libraries.

The project includes:
- Data preprocessing to tokenize and pad input sequences.
- Building and training the NMT model.
- Implementing an attention mechanism for improved translation.
- Inference to generate translations for new English sentences.

## Tools Used
Python
TensorFlow
Keras
## Usage
- 1.Prepare your dataset: Clean and preprocess your English-Marathi sentence pairs, and save them as a CSV file.
- 2.Run the preprocessing script: Run the data preprocessing script to tokenize and pad the sequences.
- 3.Build and train the model: Run the training script to build and train the NMT model with attention.
- 4.Save and load model weights: Save and load model weights using the provided functions to prevent retraining.
- 5.Inference: Utilize the trained model for translating new English sentences to Marathi.
## Results
- 1.Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, loss, and BLEU score.
- 2.Visualize and compare the predicted Marathi translations with the actual translations.
